									<p class="text-justify">Internships or Training are basically the things that the students wish to
                                    do during their 3rd Year graduation period. Their is a huge difference
                                    between the training and internships offered to the students and
                                    students often get confused between these two. All the universities and
                                    the colleges associated with any of the course instruct the students to
                                    get them a certificate of any of the internship cum training in their
                                    respective courses. <br><br> DThe major difference that holds between an internship and a training is  that during an internship period, you are being paid based on the skills
                                    and the knowledge that you own about a particular topic or a course; on
                                    the contrary, the training availed by the student is not paid and they learn
                                    a course during this tenure.</p>

                                    One of the biggest concerns when it comes to engineering students is
                                    the one of employability after the completion of their degree. Every year,
                                    out of the total engineering graduates, as many as 60% remain
                                    unemployed, and that is mostly because of lack of options and field
                                    experience.

                                    Hence, taking up competitive and viable internships in the course of the
                                    degree is important. It helps in building a professional network with some
                                    of the best people in the industry and also helps in getting the much
                                    needed field knowledge, which otherwise lacks in theoretical study.
                                    Most of the students who land up in aspiring jobs are the ones who have
                                    already successfully interned at that particular organization. This
                                    increases the employability of students and also gives them a chance to
                                    closely observe the workings of the industry they are about to step in.
                                    By doing various types of internships, students and interns also get an
                                    opportunity to explore their interests and find the perfect path so that
                                    they do not have to face much struggle in the future. For B.Tech
                                    students, it becomes more important because of the immense
                                    competition in the industry and the constant need for better performance.

                                    B.Tech, in which practical and on-field knowledge is as important as
                                    theoretical knowledge, if not more.
